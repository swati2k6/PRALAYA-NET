# Cascading Risk Analysis in PRALAYA-NET

## Overview

Cascading failures occur when one disaster triggers others, e.g., flood → power outage → hospital failure.

## GNN Model

- **Graph Representation**: Nodes = infrastructure, Edges = dependencies
- **Risk Propagation**: Simulate failure spread using NetworkX
- **Mock GNN Logic**: Random risk assignment for demo

## Example Graph

```
Flood → Power Grid → Hospital
       → Water Supply → Telecom Tower
```

## Risk Calculation

- Base risk: 0.2-0.95 (random)
- Thresholds: Low <0.3, Medium 0.3-0.6, High >0.6
- Cascading: Increase connected nodes' risk

## Visualization

- Dashboard shows network graph with color-coded risks
- Updates in real-time as disasters propagate

## Mitigation

- Decision engine triggers shutdowns to prevent cascades
- Alerts prioritize critical infrastructure

## Data

- Stored in `data/simulated/cascading.json`
- Generated by `scripts/generate_graph.py`
